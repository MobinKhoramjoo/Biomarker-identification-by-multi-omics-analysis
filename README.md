**About:**
  The code in this repository was used to generate the results presented in the article _Sequential multi-omics analysis identifies clinical phenotypes and predictive biomarkers for long COVID_ in _Cell Reports Medicine_ and _STAR protocol_.

**Background:**
  These analyses aim to identify correlations between biomarkers and clinical variables, cluster patients based on their multi-omics profile, and find predictive biomarkers.

**Repository Structure:**
1. Data Preprocessing and Statistical Analysis (R)
This section focuses on the initial steps of data preparation and statistical analysis using R. The goal is to clean and preprocess raw data and identify correlations between biomarkers and clinical variables.

2. Clustering Analysis (Python)
The clustering analysis section contains code and resources for grouping patients based on their multi-omics profile. Various clustering algorithms may be explored to understand the underlying patterns within the data.

3. Classification Analysis (Python)
Here, we delve into the classification analysis to identify predictive biomarkers. This involves the development and evaluation of models to classify patients based on specific criteria, contributing to a better understanding of the dataset.
