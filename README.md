Multi-omics analysis of long COVID patients Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the analysis conducted as part of the STAR protocol published in Cell Reports Medicine Journal. The analysis covers three main aspects: Data preprocessing and statistical analysis, clustering analysis, and classification analysis. 
These analyses aim to identify correlations between biomarkers and clinical variables, cluster patients based on their multi-omics profile, and find predictive biomarkers.

Repository Structure
Data Preprocessing and Statistical Analysis (R)
Directory: Biomarker-identification-by-multi-omics-analysis/Data Preprocessing- Statistical Data Analysis- clinical correlation identification.R
This section focuses on the initial steps of data preparation and statistical analysis using R. The goal is to clean and preprocess raw data and identify correlations between biomarkers and clinical variables.

Clustering Analysis (Python)
Directory: 
The clustering analysis section contains code and resources for grouping patients based on their multi-omics profile. Various clustering algorithms may be explored to understand the underlying patterns within the data.

Classification Analysis (Python)
Directory: 
Here, we delve into the classification analysis to identify predictive biomarkers. This involves the development and evaluation of models to classify patients based on specific criteria, contributing to a better understanding of the dataset.
